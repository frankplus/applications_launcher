 * Mirrors RecentsOverlay's filter (drop launcher + systemui), and also
 * drops the first entry returned by missionManager — that's the
 * foreground mission, already covered by SnapshotCapture's live
 * screenshot. Caps the result at MAX_RECENTS to keep both the snapshot
 * batch latency and the Row's pixel footprint bounded.
