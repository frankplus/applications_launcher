 * OHOS does not expose a live, transformable surface handle for the
 * foreground app (the JS equivalent of Android's RemoteAnimationTarget
 * .leash is internal-only — see plans/sharded-doodling-gosling.md).
 * Instead we capture a PixelMap of the live display via
 * @ohos.screenshot.save() at gesture start and render it in an
 * overlay window that we transform per-frame.
 *
 * Capture is best-effort: a failure logs at WARN and leaves the
 * AppStorage key unset, in which case the overlay renders nothing and
 * the existing dock + commit path still works.
